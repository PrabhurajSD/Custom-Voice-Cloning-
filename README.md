# Custom-Voice-Cloning-

Steps to run the Model :
1) Setup Environment: Ensure you have a suitable Python environment with all the required libraries and dependencies installed. (Take reference from code)
2) Prepare Custom Voice Data: Before running the model, you need to have the custom voice data available (audio must be in  WAV format and in chunks of 10 secs ).
   Ensure that you have the voice data files ready and organized.

4) Specify Text Input
5) Run the Model (Google Collab is preferred)

Evaluating Model Performance:
 1) Accuracy: How closely does the generated speech resemble the target speaker's natural voice?
 2) Fluency: How natural and smooth is the generated speech?
 3) Understandability: How clear and easy to understand is the generated speech?
 4) Code quality, the less the code the better.
 5) The time taken to submit, the less the better.
 6) Response times, the faster the better.
